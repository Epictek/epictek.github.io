      <description>My girlfriend has recently been streaming pubg on twitch, she asked me to set everything up for her so of course I had to overcomplicate it.
What is NDI? NDI is a standard designed for low latency video feeds over a network. Why is this useful?
Well streaming to services such as Twitch requires a decent amount of processing power due to the encoding required. NDI is an almost &amp;ldquo;lossless&amp;rdquo; stream meaning that we can offload the processing to a second &amp;ldquo;streaming&amp;rdquo; PC leaving more CPU for playing games which is especially useful for games such as Pubg that are very CPU demanding.</description>
